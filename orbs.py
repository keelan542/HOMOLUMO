# Ask user for the name of the .log file to analyse

# Open up the file and start reading it

# Once we reach the orbital section, start adding the orbitals to dicts (one for O and one for V)

# Locate HOMO and LUMO energies from dictionaries

# Calculate HOMO-LUMO gap, convert to eV and print this information out
